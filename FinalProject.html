   This page is going to be about me <b>Mathew Sisson</b>. While most of the time I would not have too much to say about my self in an assignment, I think that this format may be fun to go over somethings about me. For this home page area I will use it as a basic overview of my self and then have links to other pages that will go more indept in diffrent areas of intrest about my self.
